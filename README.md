# Classification-of-tumors-knn

Implementation of Knn algorithm in Python using scikit-learn

## Dataset Information

* Title: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database

* This breast cancer databases was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg.

* Number of Instances: 699

* Number of Attributes: 10 plus the class attribute

* Attribute Information:
  * ID number 
  * Diagnosis (2 = malignant, 4 = benign)  
  Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: 
  * radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
  * texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
  * perimeter 
  * area 
  * smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
  * compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 
  * concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
  * concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 
  * symmetry 
  * fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
